| I'm (very | super | really) glad to ((meet | know) you | learn about you).  ->  I'm very glad to know you. 
```

### Weighted Choice

### Assignment
Basic assignments do not have output, they simply create or update a symbol

```

The weather was $desc  ->  The weather was wet and cold 
```

### Inline Assignment

Inline assignments create/modify a symbol _and_ output its contents

```

     ->  Jane was from Berlin. Berlin is cold and wet.

$place=(New York | Berlin | Shanghai)`<br/>`$place is cold and wet in winter. 
     ->  Berlin is cold and wet in the winter.
    
In [$place=(New York | Berlin | Shanghai)] it is cold and wet in winter. 
     ->  In Berlin it is cold and wet in the winter.
```


### Transforms

```
The group of boys (to run).conjugate().
How many (tooth | menu | child).pluralize() do you have?
How many (tooth | menu | child).pluralize().toUpper() do you have?

// Resolves choice without repeating
How many (tooth | menu | child).norepeat() do you have?

// Resolves choice in sequence
How many (tooth | menu | child).seq() do you have?
```
